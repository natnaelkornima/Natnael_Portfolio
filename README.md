# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This project is my first major undertaking in web development, built from the ground up using pure HTML and CSS. It serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skills, educational background, interests, and the projects I'm passionate about.

The primary goal of this portfolio is to create a clean, modern, and fully responsive online presence that effectively communicates my journey as a budding software engineer and frontend developer.

This project was built using fundamental web technologies:

## ⚠️ Important Note

Please be aware of the following:

-   **This is my first project:** As this is my foundational portfolio project, the "Projects" section contains placeholder examples. The GitHub and Live Demo links in that section are not functional at this time. They are there to demonstrate the layout and will be updated as I complete more projects.
-   **Sample CV:** The "Download CV" button links to a sample CV for demonstration purposes only. It is not my actual resume.
